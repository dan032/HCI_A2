# True North Covid Assist
This application was designed for my Human Computer Interaction course, and is a prototype for an application that connects volunteers with those who are in need of assistance as a result of COVID-19.

# Features
1) Location Services which enables the app to provide up to date information for your specific location
2) A guide to how to prevent the spread of COVID
3) Functionality to request for aid
4) Functionality to connect volunteers with those who need aid
5) Allows volunteers to choose which request they help with so they can more efficiently apply their services

# Future Goals
1) Provide means for in-app communication instead of offloading those services to email.
2) Provide information about nearby testing centers 
3) Provide access to information regarding the availability of vaccines.
4) Provide support for multiple languages to ensure that as many individuals can use the app as possible
